PLAN FOR THE PACMAN

1. create the pacman envoirnment
    1.1: game world (tkinter library)
    1.2: food pallets
    1.3: ghosts
    1.4: pacamnt 
    1.5: actions avaialble for pacman,ghosts form given position(states)


2. identify states,actions,reward etc from envoirnment
    2.1 position of pacman, ghosts, food pallets, fruit
    2.2 valid actions from the current states
        2.2.1 hit the wall and stay in same cell
        2.2.2 some stochasticity can be added(some prbability to take other direction than intended)
        2.2.3 if ghost is is some range try to avoid. vise versa for ghost
    2.3 going away from ghost and collecting as food pallets will give positive reward etc. 

3. build DQN accodingly to test PACMAN
    3.1 pytorch for building Deep Q Network for traiing pacman 
    3.2 ghosts can have some fixed policies

4. Test the results

5. try some extra policies with PACMAN and ghosts
